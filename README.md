# System Usage Reporting
This project mainly aims to analyze system usage centered on batteries and processes and how these two factors affect CPUs under multitasking activities. From our study, we will see that minimum reliability requirements differentials from ST cases and MT cases.

## Building the project stages using run.py
To get the data, from the project root dir, run python run.py data
This command will have Python run the bat files "go_battery.bat" and "go_processes.bat" to collect data, which will be saved to the output directory at src/data/project/output.

### Responsibilities 
* Group member Yingyin Xiao developed the run.py file, the parameters in config/data-params.json and the checkpoint-1 report.
* Group member Sijie Mei did the same thing.
